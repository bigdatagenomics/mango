Building Mango from Source
==========================

You will need to have Java 8 and  `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__
version 3.1.1 or later installed in order to build Mango.

    **Note:** The default configuration is for Hadoop 2.7.3. If building
    against a different version of Hadoop, please pass
    ``-Dhadoop.version=<HADOOP_VERSION>`` to the Maven command. Mango
    will cross-build for both Spark 1.x and 2.x, but builds by default
    against Spark 1.6.3. To build for Spark 2, run the
    ``./scripts/move_to_spark2.sh`` script.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/mango.git
    cd mango
    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"
    mvn clean package -DskipTests

Outputs

Running Mango
-------------

Mango is packaged as an
`überjar <https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/>`__ and
includes all necessary dependencies, except for Apache Hadoop and Apache
Spark.

Building for Python
-------------------

To build and test `Mango’s Python bindings <#python>`__, first set environmental variables pointing to the root of your Mango and Spark installation directories.

.. code:: bash

   export SPARK_HOME=<PATH_TO_SPARK>
   export MANGO_HOME=<PATH_TO_MANGO> 
   
Next, build Mango jars without running tests, by running the following command from the root of the Mango repo install directory:

.. code:: bash

   mvn clean package  -DskipTests

Additionally, the PySpark dependencies must be on the Python module load path and the Mango JARs must be built and provided to PySpark. This can be done with the following bash commands: 

.. code:: bash

   PY4J_ZIP="$(ls -1 "${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib" | grep py4j)"
   export PYTHONPATH=${SPARK_HOME}/python:${SPARK_HOME}/python/lib/${PY4J_ZIP}:${PYTHONPATH}
   ASSEMBLY_DIR="${MANGO_HOME}/mango-assembly/target"
   ASSEMBLY_JAR="$(ls -1 "$ASSEMBLY_DIR" | grep "^mango-assembly[0-9A-Za-z\_\.-]*\.jar$" | grep -v javadoc | grep -v sources || true)"
   export PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS="--jars ${ASSEMBLY_DIR}/${ASSEMBLY_JAR} --driver-class-path ${ASSEMBLY_DIR}/${ASSEMBLY_JAR} pyspark-shell"


Next, install dependencies using the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   cd mango-python
   make prepare
   cd ..
   cd mango-viz
   make prepare
   cd ..
   
Finally, run ``mvn package`` again, this time enabling the ``python`` profile as well as tests:   


.. code:: bash

    mvn package -P python

This will enable the ``mango-python`` and ``mango-viz`` module as part of the Mango build.
This module uses Maven to invoke a Makefile that builds a Python egg and
runs tests.
